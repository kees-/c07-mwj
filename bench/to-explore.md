### Dynamic charms

Trying another charm, a Spotify embed, behaved strangely. I think it is that content loaded in an `iframe` is not playing well with my very basic wrappers.
- Gestures were not recognized within the player `iframe`. I did not imagine they would be.
- The charm would collide well with the side window boundaries. It displayed unexpected sticking behavior with the bottom of the window, and clipping with the top.
